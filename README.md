## Future Developments and Improvements

1. Accessibility

Need to add proper heading structure and keyboard navigation support to enhance accessibility.

2. Performance Optimisation

Am aware that the animations I've included could impact performance.

3. Responsive Design

Need to add additional media queries and responsive styles to ensure an optimal experience across various screen sizes and device orientations.

4. Code Organisation

My CSS file contains a mix of styles for different components and pages, which has made it challenging for me to maintain and scale. I need to adopt a more systematic approach to styling.

5. Form Validation and Submission

The contact form on the contact page currently lacks client-side validation and submission handling. Will be adding Formspree component.

6. Semantic HTML

Need to include more semantic HTML. Similar to CSS, I need to be more systematic in my approach and not let the bad habits I've learned in the past become any more entrenched than they already are.

7. Documentation and Comments

While the code is relatively straightforward, adding comments and documentation can improve readability and make it easier for me to make changes in the future.
